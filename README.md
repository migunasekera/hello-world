# hello-world
This is my first repository! I am a recent graduate from Stony Brook University in Biomedical Engineering. Knowing the power of machine learning as a consumer, I am interested in learning more about it so I can apply it into medical problems, and hopefully make some contributions!

Currently taking a Data structures class at Stony Brook, which is taught in Java. Have a working knowledge of Python and Matlab. Would like to learn many more languages!

I am also a competitive tennis player, love the outdoors, and can chill to any music with a sick beat!
